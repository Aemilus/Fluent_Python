### Boolean Operations â€” `and`, `or`, `not`

[Source](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not)

These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:

| Operation | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x `or` y    | if x is false, then y, else x | see 1. |
| x `and` y | if x is false, then x, else y | see 2. |
| `not` x | if x is false, then True, else False | see 3. |

Notes:
1. This is a short-circuit operator, 
so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is false.
2. This is a short-circuit operator, 
so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is true.
3. `not` has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, 
so `not a == b` is interpreted as `not (a == b)`, 
and `a == not b` is a syntax error.
