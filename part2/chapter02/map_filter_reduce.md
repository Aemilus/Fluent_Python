## Map, Filter and Reduce

[Source](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html)

These are three functions which facilitate a functional approach to programming. 
We will discuss them one by one and understand their use cases.

### Map
Map applies a function to all the items in an input_list. Here is the blueprint:
```
map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)
```
Most of the time, we want to pass all the list elements to a function 
one-by-one and then collect the output. 
For instance:
```
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = []
for i in items:
    squared.append(i**2)
```
Map allows us to implement this in a much simpler and nicer way. 
Here you go:
```
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, items))
```
Most of the time, we use lambdas with map, so I did the same. 
Instead of a list of inputs we can even have a list of functions!
```
def multiply(x):
    return (x*x)
def add(x):
    return (x+x)

funcs = [multiply, add]
for i in range(5):
    value = list(map(lambda x: x(i), funcs))
    print(value)
```
```
# Output:
# [0, 0]
# [1, 2]
# [4, 4]
# [9, 6]
# [16, 8]
```

### Filter
As the name suggests, filter creates a list of elements 
for which a function returns true. 
Here is a short and concise example:
```
number_list = range(-5, 5)
less_than_zero = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, number_list))
print(less_than_zero)
```
```
# Output: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
```
The filter resembles a for loop, but it is a builtin function and faster.

Note: If map & filter do not appear beautiful to you 
then you can read about list/dict/tuple comprehensions.

### Reduce
Reduce is a really useful function for performing some computation on a list 
and returning the result. 
It applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. 
For example, if you wanted to compute the product of a list of integers.

So the normal way you might go about doing this task in python 
is using a basic for loop:
```
product = 1
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for num in list:
    product = product * num
```
```
# Output: 24
```
Now letâ€™s try it with reduce:
```
from functools import reduce
product = reduce((lambda x, y: x * y), [1, 2, 3, 4])
```
```
# Output: 24
```
